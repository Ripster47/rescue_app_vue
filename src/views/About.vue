          Friends of Scales Reptile Rescue (FoS) focuses solely on the rescue, rehabilitation, and rehoming of reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Friends of Scales is dedicated to the care of the ill, injured, abandoned, and the aggressive/dangerous. As an insured, bonafide reptile rescue, we strive to promote conservation through responsible pet ownership and inspire the public to take a more active role in preserving the animals we love. Friends of Scales is a tax exempt, 501(c)(3) charitable not-for-profit servicing Illinois and the Midwest since 2009.<br>
          <br>
          Our Board of Directors are all volunteers and include: veterinary professionals; reptile industry leaders; professional reptile educators; law enforcement professionals; scientists; and teachers. As a foster based organization, Friends of Scales works tirelessly with passionate individuals and families. The rescue prides itself in our ability to rehome animals in zoological facilities, educational facilities (ambassador shows, universities, grade schools, etc), sanctuaries, and private homes.</p>

          <p>All animals in our care receive veterinary attention regardless of outward healthy appearances, socialization, and premium nutrition. Monthly, it costs the rescue $500-$1,200 to maintain 15-40 animals. Every animal that comes into our rescue undergoes a full veterinary evaluation and diet modification to reflect the nutritional needs of the species.

          Reptiles are our passion, and thatâ€™s why, at Friends of Scales reptiles matter!
