            Friends of Scales Reptile Rescue was founded officially on September 6, 2011 and we have never looked back! The members below are all directors of the rescue, volunteering their time, efforts, and talents because they believe in what FoS stands for!
            <br>
            <br>
            A huge thank you to Bobby Delaney of BD3 Illustrations who donated the creation of our logo in 2011. The logo was based off our first rescue, Johnny Legs, a veiled chameleon. BD3 Illustrations continues to work with our organization to this day!
            <br>
            <br>
            Most importantly, all the directors of FoS wish to thank all our supporters, volunteers, fosters, and our fans! Without your support, we could never help all the animals in need that we do! Thank you!
            <br>
            <br>
            We pride ourselves on having a diverse board of directors that include: veterinary professionals, special education teachers, heads of reptile related industries, impassioned conservation supporters, natural history educators, and breeders. We believe the diversity of our board helps us succeed in our mission!

          Outside of the rescue I am a Certified Veterinary Technician and volunteer with the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians. I love World of Warcraft (For the Horde!) and Dungeons & Dragons. I use what I learn in these games in my daily life and even to run the rescue more effectively believe it or not! I am proud to have founded this rescue and will continue to make it a rescue that others can use as a gold standard! Every board member past and present have brought us to where the rescue is now and I could not ask for a better or more loyal team!

          Outside of the rescue I am a teachers assistant at a school for kids with emotional disorders. I love teaching people about reptiles, amphibians, and all things creepy crawly! I have held education related jobs at Brookfield zoo and teach scuba diving. I have kept a variety of cold blooded animals personally and love to spread my knowledge and passion on these animals! I am also slightly obsessed with the show Supernatural!

          Outside of the rescue I am the mother of 2 giant human boys (one that is a volunteer in the rescue), 1 giant cichlid with attitude, 2 fluffy kitties, and 1 giant beardie that thinks he’s a cat, plus any fosters that need some one on one care in the rescue. Currently working on turning my over 40 years of herpetile catching/keeping and passion into an undergraduate degree in zoology with emphasis on behavioral zoology field research, and a minor in chemistry. I plan to continue with a Masters in Behavioral Zoology while affiliated with the Brookfield Zoo in 2018. In the rescue, I started helping with marketing and now I am on the board of the best reptile rescue ever! I am obsessed with Star Wars too!

          Outside of the rescue I work in Federal law enforcement and EMS. I also co-own Coal Black Exotics (an educational program) with my wife, Teresa. I have a biology degree from Blackburn College. I got involved with the rescue because I love reptiles and I strongly advocate for educating the public about reptiles. I really enjoy all of the outreach events that the rescue participates in.

          Outside of the rescue I am a stay at home mom, small business co-owner, and a volunteer and community board member addict! I am a mother of three humans and a pet mother of 65 reptiles, 10 amphibians, and 10 invertebrates. Oh, and some non-scaled pets too. I love what the rescue does, connecting pets with people who love them regardless of how “cuddly” others consider them. I also enjoy the opportunity available for educating the public on these super under appreciated pets.

          Outside of the rescue I am a co-owner of Pekin Animal Hospital, so that is a big chunk of my time. Outside of work, I enjoy taking Kuk Sool Won classes (a Korean martial art) with my 11 year old son. We also take a kickboxing class together once a week. One week every summer I spend with my fellow runners from the St. Jude Memphis to Peoria Run. I enjoy running, triathlons, hiking, and spending time with my family and my 2 big furry Akitas, 3 crazy cats, and a menagerie of scaly friends. I also enjoy painting and drawing! I sing in our local chorus and usually get roped into the dance numbers as well. See what I mean? What DON’T I do?!
